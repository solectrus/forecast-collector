# Forecast collector

Collect solar forecast data from https://forecast.solar or https://solcast.com.au and push it to InfluxDB.

## Usage

1. Make sure your InfluxDB database is ready (not subject of this README)

2. Prepare an `.env` file (see `.env.example`) with your InfluxDB credentials and some details about your PV plant (Geo location, azimuth, declination etc.)

   Find details about the underlying APIs here:
   * [forecast.solar API documentation](https://doc.forecast.solar/api:estimate).
   * [solcast API documentation](https://docs.solcast.com.au/) in the Legacy/Hobbyist section

3. Run the Docker container on your Linux box:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
              --env-file .env \
              ghcr.io/solectrus/forecast-collector
   ```

It's recommended to integrate the `forecast-collector` into your SOLECTRUS hosting. See more here:
